NEVER use it for user authentication as it can be easily falsified (user can simply set some HTTP headers
such as X-Forwarded-Host so you should NEVER rely on it in any security checks.

use it to force you to connect to some host that is not intended to be connected to so that may cause
serious consequences.</p>
